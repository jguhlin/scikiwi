# all.sci.kiwi aggregator

Aggregates the feeds of science-based Mastodon instances. Hosted at [all.sci.kiwi](https://all.sci.kiwi)

This is an very early version of my aggregator. I've been learning the framework,
and been doing genomics much longer than HTML/CSS lately! So give me some time.
I can picture this becoming a full client as well.

As I get the hang of this framework, expect fast iteration. Open to suggestions.

## Current instances:
